# One common task for computers is to sort data. 
# For example, people might want to see all their files on a computer sorted by size. 
# Since sorting is a simple problem with many different possible solutions, 
# it is often used to introduce the study of algorithms.

# Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. 
# We will first start with a nearly sorted list.

# Insert element into sorted list: 
# Given a sorted list with an unsorted number e in the rightmost cell, 
# how can we write some simple code to insert e into the array so that it remains sorted?

# For example: arr = [1,2,4,5,3]. We can use brute-force to sort it.
